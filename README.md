# micrometa - amazing repo
**A Global Repository for all who have hobby in electronics and coding (repo to collect all examples of Arduino/Raspberry Pi/etc for fun)**

**Contributing**

- Fork this repository. 

- Create a branch.

- To add an example, navigate to the appropriate device directory and create a new directory for the programming language used. 

- Navigate to the language directory you just created. Now, create another directory named after the example to be added. 

- Navigate to the example name directory you just created. Now, add the code and the schematic--preferably in their own unique, eponymous directories.

- **MUST** include readme file. 

* If the device you want to add an example for is not listed (device does not have directory/folder in repo),
then add it yourself. This is strongly encouraged! Thank you!
